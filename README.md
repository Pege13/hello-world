Peter Grasman like to build his own APP in which it is visible and feaseable to connect project management planning decisions with operational internal assembling and shipping logistics. The workflow and operational capacity of available and allocated  working hours must be updated after a next process step of the individual employee like orderprojectplanner, work-planner with AUTOCAD/SD-WORKS, Purchaser, cabinetmakers and logistic receiving and shipping employees.
